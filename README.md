This is a game I and 2 other classmates did for a class proyect in the second semester of university.

The game is intended to be a fast paced 2d game, wich its objective is to survive as long as posible in the arena.
You can choose between two playable characters: 
  - Policeman: shots with its pistol, has 5hp, and medium speed.
  - AverageWorker: can charge is showl attack after wich it stomps the ground with it, leaving a 
  trace of the showel that does infinite damage, and remains in place for half the time the attack was charged. Has 10hp, and slow speed.

The enemies are: 
  - Robber: has 2hp, deals 1 damage, just follows you, slow speed. Appears in second 0 until second 120.
  - Motorcyclist: has 1hp, deals 1 damage, when it thouches an edge, registers your current position, and then goes in an straight line 
  in that direction, until it touches another edge. It is super fast! Appears in second 45.
  - Vagabond: has 1hp, deals 1 damage, just wanders randomly around the map. Appears in second 90.
  - Suicide: has 1hp, deals 1 damage, when killed it explodes, the explosion deals like damage, the explosion lasts for like 2 or 3 seconds.
  Appears from second 120, that way replacing the robber.
  
  To be able to play you need: mouse, keyboard.
  
You move with the WASD keys, and the character automatically points in the direction of the mouse, therefore it shoots/attack in the 
direction of the mouse.

This game is made in GreenFoot, we never exported it to be able to play it, so you will require to install GreenFoot before hand,
in my opinion is a fun game, is very difficult, but fun.

Have fun! :)
